"""
Optional Redis-backed task queue for RagLeap Core.

RagLeap Core works entirely without this - the background integration
sync job (core/api.py's _sync_job) runs each due source's sync inline in
the FastAPI process by default, exactly as before. Setting REDIS_URL
switches to enqueuing that same work onto a real Redis queue instead,
processed by separate `worker` process(es) (see docker-compose.yml's
`worker` service and Dockerfile.worker), which can then be scaled
independently of the API process - horizontally via
`docker compose up --scale worker=N`, or in Kubernetes via a queue-length
based autoscaler such as KEDA's Redis List scaler (see
examples/keda-scaledobject-worker.yaml for a reference ScaledObject).

Deliberately minimal: one queue ("default"), one job type (integration
sync) for this first version. Not a general task-queue framework - more
job types are a natural follow-up once this pattern is proven in real
use, matching the same "narrow first version" approach already used for
core/employees/triggers.py's autonomous escalation trigger.
