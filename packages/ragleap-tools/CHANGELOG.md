# Changelog

All notable changes to `ragleap-tools` are documented here. Format
loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1] - 2026-10-10

### Added

- A response-size cap and a hard total deadline for every HTTP provider
  (Tavily, Serper, GitHub search, Gemini and Anthropic vision). New optional,
  validated fields `max_response_bytes` (default 1,048,576 bytes) and
  `total_timeout` (default 20 seconds; 90 seconds for the vision providers)
  on `TavilySearchProvider`, `SerperSearchProvider`, `GitHubSearchConfig`,
  `GeminiVisionProvider` and `AnthropicVisionProvider`. Before this, urllib's
  timeout covered each socket operation rather than the whole request and the
  body was read without a limit, so a server dripping bytes (or sending a huge
  body) could hold a tool-calling loop indefinitely. An oversize response or
  an exceeded deadline now returns a failed `ToolResult` ("response exceeded N
  bytes" / "request exceeded N seconds"). GitHub error bodies are capped at
  16,384 bytes and still surfaced. Per-operation timeouts are unchanged (15
  seconds; 60 for vision). See `docs/design/http-limits.md`.

### Fixed

- `Tool.call(self, **kwargs)` raised `TypeError` when a model-chosen tool
  argument was literally named `self`. `self` is now positional-only.

### Verified

- 200 tests (the existing 133 unchanged, plus 67 new), passing locally on
  Python 3.10.12 and 3.12.3. The new tests use a real local HTTP server
  (slow-drip body, stalled body, a server that never answers, oversize with
  and without Content-Length, chunked, truncated, huge error body).
  Mutation-tested: 38 deliberate breaks, all caught.
- Live, on the new transport: Gemini vision (model `gemini-3.6-flash`, a
  generated 64x64 red PNG) returned "Red" on Python 3.10.12 on 2026-10-09;
  unauthenticated GitHub search returned results over real HTTPS, and the
  size cap, the deadline and a real HTTP 422 error body were exercised
  against api.github.com.

### Not verified

- The Anthropic vision provider, Tavily, Serper and authenticated GitHub
  requests have still not been called against live services (their requests
  now also go through the new transport, covered by local-server tests only).
- Gemini JPEG/WebP, large images and error responses have not been checked
  live.

### Known limitations

- Python cannot kill a thread. After the deadline the worker is told to stop
  and its socket is shut down on a best-effort basis (this uses private
  attributes of urllib's response object and could silently stop working in a
  future Python); if so, the worker exits within one per-operation timeout.
  Control always returns to the caller at the deadline.
- DNS resolution is not covered by the per-operation timeout.
- Responses over the cap (1 MiB by default) now fail where they previously
  succeeded; raise `max_response_bytes` if you need more.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- `describe_image` tool (`VisionConfig`, `make_vision_tool`) with a
  pluggable `VisionProvider` abstraction and two reference providers,
  `GeminiVisionProvider` and `AnthropicVisionProvider`. Bring-your-own-key:
  `api_key` and `model` are both required, no env-var fallback, no default
  provider or model. Reads images only from the sandbox directory (the same
  `FileOpsConfig` and path-escape protection as the file tools, including
  symlink escapes). URLs are deliberately not accepted (SSRF risk). The
  image type is detected from the file's bytes, not its extension; size is
  capped at 5,000,000 bytes by default (`max_image_bytes`) and the
  model-controlled prompt at 2,000 characters. Standard library only - no
  new dependency. The returned description is untrusted text derived from
  an image (prompt-injection surface; not screened). See
  `docs/design/vision-tool.md`.

### Fixed

- `GitHubSearchConfig` docstring wrongly gave 60 requests/hour per IP as
  the unauthenticated search limit (that is GitHub's unauthenticated
  core API limit). A live `/rate_limit` check on 2026-10-01 showed the
  search resource at 10 (core at 60). Documentation only - no behavior
  change. The published 0.3.0 wheel still carries the old docstring.

### Verified

- 133 tests passing (was 100). 33 new: request-building tests mock
  `urllib.request.urlopen` and assert on the real URL, headers and body of
  each provider; sandbox tests cover `../` traversal, absolute paths and a
  real on-disk symlink escape; rejected inputs are asserted never to reach
  the provider.
- Live-checked on 2026-10-03 against the real Gemini API (model
  `gemini-3.6-flash`): one `describe_image` call on a generated 64x64
  solid-red PNG returned `Red`. This confirms the `x-goog-api-key` header,
  the `inline_data` request body and the `candidates[0].content.parts[].text`
  response parsing for PNG input. One call only: JPEG and WebP input, large
  images and Gemini's error responses were not live-checked.

### Not verified

- `AnthropicVisionProvider` has not been called against a live account. Its
  request shape was checked against current public documentation only and
  its response field names were not confirmed. Treat it as best-effort.
- Gemini's supported image formats beyond PNG, and both providers' exact
  per-image size limits, were not confirmed.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- `search_github_repositories` tool (`GitHubSearchConfig`,
  `make_github_search_tool`) via the real GitHub REST API
  (`/search/repositories`). Unlike `search_web`'s providers, a token is
  optional - GitHub allows unauthenticated search at a real, lower rate
  limit, so this is not forced into the `SearchProvider` interface (see
  `docs/design/web-search-tool.md` for the full reasoning). Sets a
  real `User-Agent` header, which GitHub's API requires and rejects
  requests without. Standard library only - no new dependency.
  `num_results` clamped to 1-20, same reasoning as `search_web`.

### Verified

- 100 tests passing (was 85). 15 new: request-building tests mock
  `urllib.request.urlopen` and assert on the real query string and
  headers, including that no `Authorization` header is sent without a
  token and a `Bearer` header is sent with one.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- `search_web` tool (`WebSearchConfig`, `make_web_search_tool`) with a
  pluggable `SearchProvider` abstraction and two reference providers,
  `TavilySearchProvider` and `SerperSearchProvider`. Bring-your-own-key:
  `api_key` is required at construction, with no environment-variable
  fallback and no default provider. Standard library only
  (`urllib.request`) - `ragleap-tools` still has zero required
  dependencies. Results are normalized to `{"title", "url", "snippet"}`.
- `num_results` is model-controlled and costs the caller's paid API
  quota, so `search_web()` clamps it to 1-20 (in the tool, not the
  providers, so custom providers get it too) and rejects non-integer
  values without calling the provider. See
  `docs/design/web-search-tool.md`.

### Changed

- Web search is no longer listed as out of scope. Code execution, HTTP
  fetch and database/business-system connectors remain deferred.

### Known limitations

- Neither provider has been called against a live account. Request
  shapes were checked against each provider's current public docs; an
  earlier draft sent Tavily's key in the request body, which is not what
  its current docs show, and was corrected to a Bearer header before
  release. Treat both as best-effort until confirmed live.
- Search results are untrusted third-party text; nothing screens them
  for prompt injection.
- No caching, rate limiting or result deduplication.

### Verified

- 85 tests passing (was 69). 16 new: the provider request-building
  tests mock `urllib.request.urlopen` so each provider's real payload
  and headers are exercised (including that Tavily's key is in the
  header and absent from the body), plus the `num_results` clamp and
  the package exports.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- `search_documents` tool (`SearchConfig`, `make_search_tool`) wrapping
  `ragleap-rag`'s already-tested `retrieve()` for hybrid vector+keyword
  search over previously ingested documents. Chunk dicts are returned
  unmodified - this tool doesn't assume `ragleap-rag`'s exact field
  set. Optional `filename=` parameter scopes search to a single
  document.

### Fixed

- `ingest_document` now passes `metadata={"filename": filename}` to
  `ingest_text()`. Previously passed no metadata at all, which
  silently made every document ingested through this tool unfilterable
  by anything using `metadata_filter` (it matches against the metadata
  dict, not the `document_id`/`document_name` columns) - including the
  new `search_documents`' `filename=` parameter, which depends on this.
  Backward compatible: existing callers gain a capability, nothing
  about the tool's signature or return shape changed.

### Verified

- 69 tests, all passing (was 51 in v0.1.0). New coverage: 8 tests for
  `search_documents` (including the `filename=` metadata-filter path,
  asserted against the fake's actually-recorded `metadata_filter`
  value, not just call-succeeded), 6 tests for `ingest_document`
  (a real gap backfilled - v0.1.0 shipped this tool with zero direct
  test coverage; the metadata-threading regression this release fixes
  is exactly the kind of bug that gap would have hidden).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Initial release. `Tool`/`ToolResult` base abstraction with OpenAI
  and Gemini function-calling schema generation. Deliberately does not
  own a tool-calling execution loop - that's `ragleap-agents`' scope,
  per the project roadmap's own split.
- 12 stateless tools: calculator (safe AST-based expression
  evaluation, never `eval()`/`exec()`), `get_current_datetime`,
  `add_to_date`, `date_difference`, `convert_length`,
  `convert_weight`, `convert_temperature`, `parse_json`, `parse_csv`,
  `regex_extract`, `word_count`, `text_case_transform`.
- 3 sandboxed file-op tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, `list_files`)
  via `FileOpsConfig(root_dir=...)` - confined entirely to a
  caller-specified root directory. Path resolution follows symlinks
  before checking containment, so symlink-based sandbox escapes are
  rejected, not just naive `../` string checking.
- 1 optional ingestion tool (`make_ingest_tool`, needs the `ingest`
  extra: `pip install ragleap-tools[ingest]`) wrapping `ragleap-rag`'s
  already-tested `ingest_text()` - no new ingestion logic.
- Explicitly out of scope for this release: code execution, web
  search, HTTP fetch, and database/business-system connectors - each
  documented in the README as needing its own security-focused design
  pass rather than a rushed inclusion.

### Verified

- 51 tests, all passing. Includes real security verification, not
  just documentation: the calculator's AST whitelist is tested against
  real code-injection attempts (`__import__`, attribute access, list
  comprehensions, multi-statement injection - all correctly rejected),
  and file ops' sandboxing is tested against real path-traversal
  attempts AND a real symlink-escape attempt (a file outside the
  sandbox, symlinked from inside it - correctly rejected).
