"""
ragleap-graph: knowledge-graph-augmented retrieval for RAG systems.

Ported from a real, production GraphService (Neo4j-backed, regex entity
extraction, co-occurrence graph construction) with two deliberate
adaptations for standalone open-source use:

1. `workspace_id` (required, Django multi-tenant SaaS concept) becomes
   an optional `namespace=` parameter, defaulting to None — mirrors
   ragleap-rag's own `metadata_filter=` convention.
2. Django `settings` coupling becomes an explicit `GraphConfig`
   dataclass — zero framework dependency, same pattern as ragleap-rag's
   `EmbeddingConfig`/`ProviderConfig`.

A real security fix vs. the source this was ported from: `max_depth` in
`search_related_entities()` is validated as a bounded integer before
being used in Cypher query construction (the underlying Neo4j
variable-length-path syntax can't be parameterized normally, so the
depth value has to be validated before string formatting, not just
trusted).

    combination of properties (e.g. id + namespace + user_id). Without
    a real constraint, concurrent MERGE calls on the same logical
    identity can race and create duplicate nodes - confirmed via a real
    concurrency regression test (issue #183): 8 duplicate Document
    nodes from 6 "successful" concurrent upserts of the same document.

    This computes a single hashed key from the real identity fields, so
    a single-property uniqueness constraint (Community-compatible) can

        (sorted) entity-pair ordering the live MERGE path uses, so a
        backfilled relationship's key matches exactly what a fresh
        MERGE for that same logical pair would compute.

        CO_OCCURS_WITH is undirected; the read query explicitly
        deduplicates on relationship identity (WITH DISTINCT r) before
        reading endpoint names via startNode(r)/endNode(r), rather
        than relying on assumptions about undirected-match traversal
        semantics -- relationship identity itself is unambiguous
        regardless of how many directions a pattern match considers.

        Idempotent -- only touches relationships still missing
        composite_key, so re-running after new composite_key-aware
        data has been written does not overwrite it.

        Pass namespace= to scope the backfill to one namespace, or
        omit to backfill the whole graph. batch_size controls how
        many relationships are updated per UNWIND write.

        Returns the count of relationships updated.
