# ragleap-ops

Kubernetes deployment manifests for RagLeap Core.

Ships Deployment + Service manifests for all four `docker-compose.yml`
services (`db`, `app`, `voice`, `neo4j`), translated from the real
compose file and live-tested end-to-end on a `kind` cluster — all four
pods reached `1/1 Running` with zero restarts after a probe-timing bug
was found and fixed via live testing.

## Contents

- `k8s/` — raw Deployment, Service, PVC, Secret, and ConfigMap manifests
- Apply order: Secrets/ConfigMap → PVCs → `db` → everything else
  (`app`/`voice` depend on `db` via an init container that polls
  `pg_isready`)

## Regenerating local-only files

Two files are intentionally **not** committed (see `.gitignore`) since
they'd otherwise bake real secret values into git history:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic ragleap-app-env \
  --from-env-file=$HOME/ragleap-core/.env \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml > k8s/app-env-secret.yaml
```

## Secrets management for production (Sealed Secrets)

The kubectl create secret --from-env-file pattern above is fine for local
testing, but it leaves real credentials sitting as plaintext files and shell
history. For production, use Sealed Secrets instead (https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets) --
secrets get encrypted against your specific cluster's public key, so the
encrypted result is safe to commit to git. No other cluster can decrypt it.

One-time setup (per cluster):

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.39.1/controller.yaml
```

Sealing a secret (works offline once you have exported your cluster's public
cert -- no live cluster connection needed at seal-time, safe to run in CI):

```bash
kubeseal --controller-name sealed-secrets-controller \
  --controller-namespace kube-system --fetch-cert > sealed-secrets-pub-cert.pem

kubectl create secret generic ragleap-db-secret \
  --dry-run=client \
  --from-literal=POSTGRES_USER=ragleap \
  --from-literal=POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-real-password \
  --from-literal=POSTGRES_DB=ragleap_core \
  -o yaml | kubeseal --format yaml --cert sealed-secrets-pub-cert.pem > db-secret-sealed.yaml

kubectl apply -f db-secret-sealed.yaml
```

Important: a sealed secret is tied to the exact cluster whose public key
encrypted it. A SealedSecret sealed for one cluster will not decrypt on a
different cluster -- never copy a sealed file between environments; reseal
against each target cluster's own cert instead.

## Status

Both the raw manifests (v0.1.0) and the Helm chart (v0.2.0, `helm/ragleap-ops/`) are live-verified end-to-end on a real kind cluster — see CHANGELOG.md for the specific bugs found and fixed.

## NetworkPolicies (restricting pod-to-pod traffic)

Both k8s/ and helm/ragleap-ops/ include NetworkPolicy resources restricting
which pods can reach ragleap-db (port 5432, from ragleap-app and
ragleap-voice only) and ragleap-neo4j (ports 7474/7687, from ragleap-app
only -- ragleap-voice does not use neo4j in the current codebase).

Important: kind's default CNI (kindnet) does not enforce NetworkPolicy at
all -- policies will apply without error but traffic will not actually be
blocked. Testing NetworkPolicy enforcement requires a CNI that supports it,
such as Calico:

```bash
kind create cluster --config kind-calico-config.yaml   # disableDefaultCNI: true
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.28.0/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.28.0/manifests/custom-resources.yaml
```

Verification performed: the enforcement mechanism itself was live-tested end
to end on a real kind + Calico cluster (a labeled pod was correctly blocked
from an unlabeled target, then allowed once correctly labeled -- confirmed
via real timeout/success exit codes, not assumed). The real ragleap-db/
ragleap-neo4j label selectors were verified to match the actual Deployment
labels used elsewhere in this chart. A full live run of the complete
ragleap stack under Calico was not completed in this session due to
genuine memory constraints on the test VPS (which also runs unrelated
production services) -- Calico's own baseline overhead left too little
headroom for a 4-service stack reliably. This is an honest scope
boundary, not a claim that the policies were fully integration-tested
against the live application.

## Ingress + TLS

The Helm chart includes an optional Ingress + cert-manager Certificate
(disabled by default via `ingress.enabled: false`). Enabling it requires:

1. An NGINX Ingress Controller installed on your cluster
2. cert-manager installed, with a real ClusterIssuer configured (Let's
   Encrypt for production, or a self-signed issuer for local testing)
3. A real hostname you own, set via `ingress.hostname` in values.yaml
4. Your ClusterIssuer's name set via `ingress.clusterIssuer`

Example production ClusterIssuer (Let's Encrypt, replace the email):

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: you@example.com
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod-key
    solvers:
      - http01:
          ingress:
            ingressClassName: nginx
EOF
```

Then deploy with:

```bash
helm install ragleap-ops ./ragleap-ops \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.hostname=your-real-domain.com \
  --set ingress.clusterIssuer=letsencrypt-prod
```

Verification performed: the full Ingress + TLS chain was live-tested end to
end on a real kind cluster with a genuine NGINX Ingress Controller and
cert-manager, using a self-signed ClusterIssuer (Let's Encrypt itself
requires public DNS and internet-reachable ports, which a local kind
cluster cannot satisfy for a real ACME challenge). Confirmed via openssl:
the correct certificate was served over TLS via SNI, matching the exact
hostname requested, not a generic fallback certificate. HTTP routing
through the Ingress to the backend service was independently confirmed
working. Production Let's Encrypt issuance was not live-tested in this
session for the reason above -- the issuer configuration shown is the
standard, documented cert-manager pattern, not independently verified
against a real public domain here.

## Multi-environment deployment

Environment-specific overrides live in `helm/ragleap-ops/values-{dev,staging,prod}.yaml`,
layered on top of the base `values.yaml` (never edit the base file for a
single environment):

```bash
helm install ragleap-ops ./ragleap-ops -f values-dev.yaml       # local/dev
helm install ragleap-ops ./ragleap-ops -f values-staging.yaml   # staging
helm install ragleap-ops ./ragleap-ops -f values-prod.yaml      # production
```

`db` and `neo4j` intentionally have no `replicaCount` in any environment
file and stay hardcoded at 1 in the templates -- both are stateful,
single-writer services backed by `ReadWriteOnce` PVCs. Horizontal scaling
for either would require a genuinely different storage/clustering
architecture, not a values.yaml change, so this isn't offered as a
configurable option that would silently produce a broken multi-writer
setup if someone bumped the number.

Verified: rendered output for `app.replicaCount`/`voice.replicaCount`
and `ingress.enabled`/`ingress.hostname` confirmed to differ correctly
across all three overlay files via `helm template -f values-<env>.yaml`
-- dev (1/1, no ingress), staging (1/1, ingress enabled with its own
hostname), prod (3/2, ingress enabled with its own hostname).
