"""
Voice channel adapter for RagLeap Core.

Handles Twilio Media Streams via WebSocket: receives real-time mu-law
8kHz audio, buffers it using voice-activity detection (VAD), transcribes
completed utterances with Whisper, answers via core.chat.ask(), and
streams the reply back as TTS audio.

Single-tenant: one bot, one document set, configured entirely via .env
(see channels/voice/config.py). VAD tuning values below are carried over
from a production system where they were tuned against real call traffic.
